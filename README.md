    Products Overview: This section will provide an overview of the store's inventory, including the number of products sold, the top-selling products, and the out-of-stock products.

    Customer Overview: This section will provide an overview of the store's customer behavior, including the number of new customers, the number of returning customers, and the customer lifetime value.

    Marketing Overview: This section will provide an overview of the store's marketing efforts, including the number of email subscribers, the number of social media followers, and the conversion rate of marketing campaigns.

The implementation of the dashboard will be done using HTML and CSS. The HTML code will provide the structure of the dashboard, while the CSS code will provide the styling and layout.
